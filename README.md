# Introduction
You need to design and implement a functional post-battle screen for a session based game.
# Main Task
There are two teams, the winning team and loser team. Each team consists of 50 players.
The teams should be organized side by side. Each player has a nickname and scores and can be in two states, dead or alive. Also there should be a tooltip with additional player info (total kills and deaths) and a button to send a friend request.
# Additional Task (Optional)
Implement a dummy backend for the task using any of REST/graphQL/GRPC
